# Card-Images-GAN

The goal of the model that is able to synthesize images at a resolution of (64x64) and suitably conditioned through image labels. Once the model is trained, its evaluation is carried out in terms of Inception Score and FID. The model will be used to generate synthetic dataset as a form of data augmentation for training a classifier on the labels used for conditioning and assess whether it provides a contribution to classification performance or not.
